**Hey, welcome to my website!**

This was a fun project I made that involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.

*Challenges*
One of the unexpected challenging aspects of this project was animating the triangles
on the page with the about me info. I originally had issues making it so the triangles
would appear and disappear outside the main view of the page. I fixed this by creating
a wrapper surrounding each triangle element and scaling it so it is the height of the
page viewer's monitor. I created a spinning animation for the child element, and translated
the wrapper's y coordinates up or down depending on the triangle.

*Things I still need to fix*
- Apply @media rules to fix formatting of page on different screen sizes or devices
